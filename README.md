## About the Project
* This is a quick frontend mock-up iOS Project built using React Native & TypeScript for a Smart Home Dashboard.
* The main purpose of this app is to showcase clean and structured React Native real-life app development.
* While the app itself does not have additional functionalities beyond displaying this information, it is capable of accepting and passing data to populate the card section dynamically i.e: able to renders multiple instances of the component, each populated with data obtained from dataMockUp.ts via props.

2. Install CodeX and Metro on your machine.
3. Run `npx react-native start` to start the Metro server.
